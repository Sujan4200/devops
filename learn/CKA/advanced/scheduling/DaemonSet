DaemonSets-> similar to ReplicaSets, as it helps to deploy multiple instances of a pod
----------
	- But, it runs one copy of your pod on each node in your cluster.
	- If new node added, replica is added to that node and vice-versa.
	- Ensures one copy of a pod is always present in all nodes in the cluster.

USE CASE:
---------
	- To deploy monitoring agent/ logs aggregator in all nodes
	- kube-proxy
	- Networking (weave-net)

INFO:
-----
	- Creation is similar to creation of ReplicaSets

Sample YAML File:
-----------------
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: monit-daemon
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: monit-agent
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: monit-agent
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: monit-agent
        image: monit-agent

Command:
--------
kubectl get daemonsets / kubectl get ds
kubectl describe ds <daemonSetName>

NOTE:
-----
- Instead of writing the manifest file, we can generate one with --dry-run option.
- But, DaemonSet manifest files cannot be created directly with such commands.
- Thus, we need to generate manifest file for deployment and later make few changes to the file.
	
	Changes to be made in file:
	---------------------------
		- Change: kind: DaemonSet
		- Remove replicas, strategy and status
