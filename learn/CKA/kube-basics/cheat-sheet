# Create a POD-definition YAML file for redis and save it to redis.yml file:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
kubectl run redis --image redis --dry-run=client -o yaml > redis.yml

# Scale replicasets:
--------------------
1. Update 'replicas' in yaml file for replicasets and apply command:
    kubectl replace -f replicaset.yml

2. Update replicasets with kubectl ad-hoc commands, this will not update replica sets value in yml file:
    kubectl scale --replicas=6 -f replicaset.yml (with replica.yml defn file)
    kubectl scale --replicas=6 -f replicaset myapp-replicaset (with type and name of resource)

3. Edit the replicaset (with kubectl):
    kubectl edit replicaset <name_of_replicaSet>
