To set up your Docker Swarm services (abc and xyz) to be accessible through subdomains (test.nik.com and demo.nik.com) via NGINX, 
I'll provide you with two separate NGINX configuration files. These configurations will handle the redirection of each subdomain
to the appropriate service running in your Docker Swarm.

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name test.nik.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://abc:3000; # Assuming the service is running on port 3000 within the Swarm
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}

• The standard notice period for all employees is one month. Employees should inform their immediate supervisors and HR of their resignation at least one month in advance of their intended last working day and such date should be recorded on the resignation tool.

• In the case of an employment period of more than a year, at least 30 days.

• In exceptional cases where an employee is unable to serve the full notice period, the employee must request a shorter notice period from their supervisor and HR. Such requests will be considered based on the reasons provided by the employee and the company's operational requirements. Please note that it is important for the team a proper transition time for smooth knowledge transfer and handover.

• If the company accepts a shorter notice period, the employee's salary will be proportionally deducted for the remaining days to compensate for the shortfall.

• Resignation requests will not be cancelled on the same day as the exit day to ensure a smooth exit process and to maintain the company's operational efficiency.

• If an employee wishes to withdraw their resignation after submitting it, they must get approval from their respective Managers/Directors and HR. Once the resignation has been processed and notice period has begun, the company reserves the right to decide on the acceptance of the withdrawal request.

• Exit Interviews: All employees leaving the company are encouraged to participate in an exit survey and interview. The purpose of the survey and exit interview is to gain insights into the employee's experience, gather feedback on the company's policies and practices, and identify areas for improvement.

• Return of Company Property: Employees are responsible for returning all company property and assets before their last working day. Failure to do so may result in the cost of the items being deducted from the final settlement.
